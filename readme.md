**Disclaimer**

I am not claiming this will fix anything or improve the performance of your store. Use at your own risk.

This is not intended to be a long-term solution for stores with systemic issues. This is meant to help solve real-world problems with stores suffering from deadlocks while they work out their own hardware, plugin, customization, other issues.
